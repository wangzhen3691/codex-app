# Codex App Mirror

Small GitHub Actions mirror for official OpenAI Codex desktop app installers.

This repository does not build or modify Codex. It downloads current official
installer packages and publishes them as GitHub Release assets.

## Assets

- Windows x64 MSIX from Microsoft Store product `9PLM9XGG6VKS`
- macOS Apple Silicon DMG from OpenAI's Codex desktop URL
- macOS Intel DMG from OpenAI's Codex desktop URL

## Run

Use the `Mirror Codex App Installers` workflow from the Actions tab.

The workflow creates a release tagged like:

```text
codex-app-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

It also runs every 15 minutes. Scheduled runs first probe the current upstream
installer versions and compare them with the latest GitHub Release. If nothing
changed, the workflow stops before downloading installers or publishing a new
release. Manual runs can set `force_release` to publish even when the probe
matches the latest release.

## Sources

The macOS URLs are the same URLs used by the official `openai/codex` CLI
`codex app` installer implementation:

- `https://persistent.oaistatic.com/codex-app-prod/Codex.dmg`
- `https://persistent.oaistatic.com/codex-app-prod/Codex-latest-x64.dmg`

The Windows package URL is resolved from Microsoft Store DisplayCatalog/FE3
metadata using ProductId `9PLM9XGG6VKS`, then downloaded from the returned
Microsoft CDN URL.

## Notes

Microsoft Store CDN URLs are temporary, so the workflow stores the downloaded
MSIX as a release asset instead of trying to preserve the original CDN URL.

Microsoft documents that `winget download` for Store packaged apps requires
Entra ID authentication, which is not suitable for unattended GitHub-hosted
runners. This repository therefore uses the same Microsoft Store metadata path
that the Store client ultimately relies on for package CDN URLs, implemented
directly with .NET and without third-party Store helper packages.

Each new release includes `release-manifest.json`, which records the Windows
MSIX moniker plus the macOS DMG HTTP fingerprints used by the polling check.
